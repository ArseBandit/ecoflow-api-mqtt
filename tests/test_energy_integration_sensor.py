"""Regression coverage for EcoFlowIntegralEnergySensor on HA 2026.8+.

home-assistant/core PR #177596 ("Do not set a device on YAML integration
entities", merged 2026-07-30) removed the ``hass`` parameter from
``homeassistant.components.integration.sensor.IntegrationSensor.__init__``.
Because ``IntegrationSensor`` is treated as internal API by Home Assistant
core, this change was not listed on the official breaking-changes page, so
integrations subclassing it (like ``EcoFlowIntegralEnergySensor``) started
raising ``TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hass'``
at entity-creation time as soon as a user upgraded to HA 2026.8, with no
prior warning.

These tests exercise the real construction path against whatever
``homeassistant`` version is installed, and also verify that ``hass`` is
still forwarded when the installed ``IntegrationSensor`` predates the
breaking change.
